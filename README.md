# SwimPool

SwimPool is a toolkit to analyze sequencing data from pooled samples (Pool-Seq).
The main aims of the project are to:

* Normalize the file formats used in Pool-Seq with widely used standards
* Provide tested implementation of published algorithms
* Simplify the development of new algorithms with a robust framework

Enjoy diving into your Pool-Seq in the _**swimpler**_ way!
